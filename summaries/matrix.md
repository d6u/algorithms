# Matrix

- [311-sparse-matrix-multiplication.java](./leetcode-java/311-sparse-matrix-multiplication.java)

    Given two sparse matrices A and B, return the result of AB. You may assume that A's column number is equal to B's row number.

- [286-walls-and-gates.js](./leetcode-js/286-walls-and-gates.js)

    You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values.

    - -1 - A wall or an obstacle.
    - 0 - A gate.
    - INF - Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 231 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.

    Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.

- [079-word-search.java](./leetcode-java/079-word-search.java)

    Given a 2D board and a word, find if the word exists in the grid. The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cell, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

- [240-search-a-2d-matrix-ii.java](./leetcode-java/240-search-a-2d-matrix-ii.java)

    Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

    - Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
    - Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

- [361-bomb-enemy.java](./leetcode-java/361-bomb-enemy.java)

    Given a 2D grid, each cell is either a wall 'W', an enemy 'E' or empty '0' (the number zero), return the maximum enemies you can kill using one bomb. The bomb kills all the enemies in the same row and column from the planted point until it hits the wall since the wall is too strong to be destroyed. Note that you can only put the bomb at an empty cell.

- [130-surrounded-regions.java](./leetcode-java/130-surrounded-regions.java)

    Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'. A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

- [200-number-of-islands.java](./leetcode-java/200-number-of-islands.java)

    Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

- [221-maximum-square.java](./leetcode-java/221-maximum-square.java)

    Given a 2D binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

- [304-range-sum-query-2d-immutable.java](./leetcode-java/304-range-sum-query-2d-immutable.java)

    Given a 2D matrix matrix, find the sum of the elements inside the rectangle defined by its upper left corner (row1, col1) and lower right corner (row2, col2).

    - You may assume that the matrix does not change.
    - There are many calls to sumRegion function.
    - You may assume that row1 ≤ row2 and col1 ≤ col2.

- [348-design-tic-tac-toe.java](./leetcode-java/348-design-tic-tac-toe.java)

    Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid. You may assume the following rules:

    - A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
    - Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
    - A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
