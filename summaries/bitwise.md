- [136-single-number.js](./leetcode-js/136-single-number.js)

    Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

- [260-single-number-iii.js](./leetcode-js/260-single-number-iii.js)

    Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

- [137-single-number-ii.java](./leetcode-java/137-single-number-ii.java)

    Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one. Find that single one.

- [089-gray-code.java](./leetcode-java/089-gray-code.java)

    The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit. Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

- [201-bitwise-and-of-numbers-range.java](./leetcode-java/201-bitwise-and-of-numbers-range.java)

    Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

- [318-maximum-product-of-word-lengths.java](./leetcode-java/318-maximum-product-of-word-lengths.java)

    Given a string array words, find the maximum value of length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters. You may assume that each word will contain only lower case letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.
